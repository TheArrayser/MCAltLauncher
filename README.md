# MCAltLauncher
No need to migrate your mojang account ;-)

You need the patched authlib for lower versions. The one for 1.18.2 is part of the submit. Launch genTokenAndLaunch.exe with your registered Username as the first paramter and your password as the second parameter. If you do not want to generate tokens all the time, then you can just modify launch.bat accordingly.
